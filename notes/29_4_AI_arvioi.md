### Evaluation of Current Progress

Given the constraints of this being a student project without access to cloud resources like AWS, the current implementation aligns well with the outlined architecture. Here's a detailed evaluation:

---

### **1. Authentication Service**
**Current Implementation:**
- **Features:**
  - User registration (`/auth/register`).
  - User login with JWT token generation (`/auth/login`).
  - JWT-based authentication for API endpoints.
  - Password hashing with `bcrypt`.

**Strengths:**
- Secure password storage with `bcrypt`.
- Stateless authentication using JWT tokens.
- Role-based user model (`role` field in the `User` table).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Token Revocation:** Add a mechanism to revoke tokens (e.g., a blacklist or token versioning).
- **Admin Authentication:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin-specific actions.
- **Error Handling:** Improve error messages for better debugging (e.g., distinguish between invalid credentials and inactive accounts).

---

### **2. File Storage Service**
**Current Implementation:**
- **Features:**
  - File upload (`/file/upload`).
  - File download (`/file/download`).
  - File listing (`/file/list`).
  - File deletion (`/file/delete`).
- Files are stored on the local disk.
- Metadata is stored in PostgreSQL.

**Strengths:**
- Clear separation of file content (stored on disk) and metadata (stored in the database).
- User-specific file storage with proper folder organization.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **File Versioning:** Add support for version control of uploaded files.
- **Scalability:** While local disk storage is sufficient for a student project, consider abstracting the storage layer to allow future integration with distributed storage systems (e.g., MinIO or Ceph).
- **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling for file operations (e.g., disk space issues, file not found).

---

### **3. Metadata Service**
**Current Implementation:**
- Metadata is stored in PostgreSQL.
- Metadata includes file ID, name, path, size, owner, and timestamps.

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured metadata schema.
- Queries are user-specific, ensuring proper isolation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Search and Filtering:** Add support for advanced queries (e.g., search by name, filter by size or date).
- **Indexing:** Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., `owner_id`, `file_name`) for better performance.

---

### **4. CLI Application**
**Current Implementation:**
- Commands for file operations (`upload`, `download`, `list`, `delete`).
- Authentication commands (`register`, `login`, `logout`).

**Strengths:**
- User-friendly CLI with `typer`.
- Clear separation of concerns between CLI and backend.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Progress Indicators:** Add progress bars for file uploads/downloads (e.g., using `tqdm`).
- **Error Messages:** Improve CLI error messages for better user experience.
- **Threading:** Use threading or async I/O for non-blocking file transfers.

---

### **5. System Architecture**
**Current Implementation:**
- Modular design with clear separation of services (auth, file, metadata).
- Stateless API design using JWT tokens.
- PostgreSQL for metadata storage.

**Strengths:**
- The architecture is modular and easy to extend.
- PostgreSQL is a reliable choice for metadata storage.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Service Communication:** Consider using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication between services.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls or database operations.
- **Monitoring:** Add logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system health.

---

### **6. Distributed Nature**
**Current State:**
- The system is modular but not fully distributed. Storage and database are centralized.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Distributed File Storage:** While local disk storage is sufficient for now, consider abstracting the storage layer to allow future integration with distributed storage systems.
- **Database Scalability:** Use a distributed database (e.g., CockroachDB) or implement sharding in PostgreSQL.
- **Service Deployment:** Deploy services on a container orchestration platform (e.g., Docker Compose for now, Kubernetes in the future).

---

### **7. Additional Features**
**Short-Term Goals:**
- Add file versioning.
- Implement advanced metadata queries.
- Improve CLI usability (e.g., progress bars, better error handling).

**Long-Term Goals:**
- Introduce a sync service for automatic file synchronization.
- Add a web interface for non-CLI users.
- Implement distributed storage and database solutions.

---

### Summary
The project is well-structured and aligns with the intended architecture. For a student project, the current implementation is impressive and functional. To further improve:
1. Focus on enhancing error handling and user experience.
2. Abstract the storage layer for future scalability.
3. Add optional features like file versioning and advanced metadata queries.

These improvements will make the system more robust and closer to a production-grade distributed system.
