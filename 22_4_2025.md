## 🧠 System Architecture & Microservices

* Look at architecture_and_microservices.md

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* Authentication service
    * Login and registration
    * JWT/token
    * bcrypt hashing
    * User authentication
    * Admin authentication
    * API
        * POST /auth/register
        * POST /auth/login
        * GET /auth/authenticate
    * DB
        * users (id, username, email, password hash, role etc.)

## 🗃️ File Storage & Metadata Handling

* PostgreSQL for Metadata
* Local Disk for file storage
    *  HTTP Multipart/Form-Data Uploads

## 🔁 CLI Program Design & Threading

* Something that works with FastAPI
* CLI is priority, Web App after that if time
* Threading for file transfer -> CLI stays in use

## 🔌 RPC + REST + Optional SOAP

* Let's go with FastAPI
